# Indispensable Apps for the Mac

Apps available from the Mac App Store are marked with .

## Text editing
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is your code editor of choice. It’s fully customizable and extensible, with a thriving community pumping out lots of handy features and utilities (such as the awesome ⌘D multiple selection cursor). I’ll do a separate write-up on my Sublime Text setup.
- [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/)  — Only enterprise n00bs still use WYSIWYG text processors like MS Word, Pages, and the like. _Sublime Text_ definitely is the all-round plain text editor of choice, both for coding and for writing. But iA Writer is a gorgeous alternative, with focus on anything but writing.
- Still, there’s a lot of competition in the writing app space. I will be doing a full write-up, someday — and perhaps even take up my own implementation, some other day. Meanwhile, from time to time, I play around with [TexPad](https://www.texpadapp.com/osx)  for LaTeX authoring, and [Ulysses](http://www.ulyssesapp.com/)  for more complex writing projects. I need to take a better look at [Mou](http://mouapp.com/), as well.

## Editing tabular data
- [CSVEditor](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/csveditor-2/id644191861)  is a plain and simple tool for editing tabular data.
- [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) — When things get heavier, there’s nothing more powerful than _OpenRefine_ (previously known as “Google Refine”). It comes with its own expression language, allowing for complex batch editing. I relied on it heavily for [my post-doc work](http://www.rhythmus.be/AnthroponymicalLexicon).
- [OmniOutliner Professional](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner)  — OmniOutliner came as a bundled app on my first Mac. I started using it, created hundreds of `.oo3` files, upgraded to Professional, and meanwhile locked myself in — I depend on OmniOutliner (i.a. for my bookkeeping :$). It’s a classic innovative all-rounder. I purchased a license before the Mac App Store even existed — curious if I can port my license to a ✓ on my Apple ID…

## Graphic Design: the obligatory Adobe Suite
- [InDesign CC](www.adobe.com/InDesign) — Indispensable. 
- [Photoshop CC](www.adobe.com/Photoshop) — No comment.
- [Acrobat](www.adobe.com/Acrobat) XI Pro
- [Illustrator CC](www.adobe.com/Illustrator)
- [After Effects CC](www.adobe.com/AfterEffects)
- [Adobe Muse CC](http://www.adobe.com/Muse) — Curious…

## Font creation
- I’m still looking for a replacement to the hopelessly obsolete _FontLab_. However powerful, the FLOSS _FontForge_ standard has a GUI that is not my thing (to put it gently); getting it running on OSX is a pain. [Glyphs](http://www.glyphsapp.com/)  really is a nice app, but I never used it in production, yet. Perhaps [Robofont](http://robofont.com/) might suit my (demanding) needs somewhat better.

## Browser
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) and its extensions — Chrome is the indispensable `-webkit` browser. Its developer tools (notably the Inspector) make it the de facto standard amongst webdevs. Chrome has one major drawback: its insatiable memory consumption… Anyhow, Chrome needs some pimping. These are my favorite extensions:
-- [Feedly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/feedly/ndhinffkekpekljifjkkkkkhopnjodja)
-- [Web Developer](http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/) is a need-have for web developers, especially because of its responsive previews.
-- [Georgify](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/georgify/ofjfdfaleomlfanfehgblppafkijjhmi): a neat user stylesheet for news.ycombinator.com a.k.a. “Hacker News”. **We’ll be rolling our own HN web app soon…**
-- [Session Buddy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko)
-- [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg)

## Calendar
- [Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical) 
- [BusyCal](http://www.busymac.com/busycal/index.html) 

## Mail
Once upon a time, people sent each other messages using an ancient internet protocol. It was cool, back then, to get a ping and a kind word, once in a while, in your “inbox”. But then the messages came in daily floods, and people also started “attaching” megabytes of dumb files to their “e-mails”. Their computers got stuffed with huge directories of darkness. Worse still, each day evil Russians sent millions of e-mails over the Interwebs, polluting the skies with tons of CO². One needed “spam” filters, people’s mental health got messed up over “POP3” vs “IMAP”. You got “Exchange servers”, and ITC departments were doing almost nothing else than untangling the confusion. Internet businesses to which one could outsource the arcane e-mail management, thrived. Matters grew worse when it turned out that evil Americans had been reading all the world’s letters ever since! Soon after, electronic mail died — and nobody cared.

## Sysadmin
- [Carbon Copy Cloner](http://www.bombich.com/)
- [DaisyDisk](http://www.daisydiskapp.com/)  — Hard drive space inspector. Too pretty to not have.
- [Name Mangler](http://manytricks.com/namemangler/)  — Simple utility for renaming lots of files in one go. Nothing special, nothing that can’t be done from the command line, but the graphical interface is clean, there’s several options, and the tool is faster than anything like it.
- [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/)  — The ftp client of choice.
- [Fontcase](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/fontcase/) 
- ~~[Memory Sweeper Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/memory-sweeper-pro/id440010327)~~  — With a new machine clocking in @ 16Gb of RAM, I hope I won’t need this once indispensable utility any longer…

## Scanning & OCR
- [VueScan](http://www.hamrick.com/) — I still got my everlasting Agfa SnapScan e50 (which I bought in 1997!). Agfa (our Belgian pride graphics company) discontinued its consumer scanner product line back in 2001 — and support for their drivers with it. VueScan came to my rescue as the powerhouse generic scanning app.
- [ABBY FineReader Express](http://finereader.abbyy.com/finereader_for_mac/)  — When it comes to OCR, choice on the Mac is poor. Abby’s FineReader Pro is an OCR standard, running on Windows. Recently they put an “Express” version in the Mac App Store.

## Varia utilities
- [Patterns The Regex App](http://krillapps.com/patterns/)  
- [RegExRX](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/regexrx/id498370702) 
- QREncoderPro 
- EANEncoder 
- Icon Slate 
- GIF Brewery 
- GIF Animator 
